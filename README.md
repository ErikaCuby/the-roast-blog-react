# 🧠 The Roast Blog — A Sassy React Project with Erika & Luma

Hi! I’m Erika — a curious millennial learning to code, drink cappuccinos, and occasionally be roasted by my AI sidekick, Luma.

This project started as a playful blog idea, but it quickly became a deep dive into **React development**, dynamic routing, component logic, and everything in between.  
It’s my first real project where I explored **dynamic rendering**, **state logic**, and **interactive UI** — and yes, **I cried over `useEffect`** more than once.

## 💡 Why I Built This

I created this blog for a few reasons:

- To **practice React.js** in a real-world setting  
- To challenge myself with **dynamic content and route-based logic**  
- To design something **aesthetic, modular, and personal**  
- To make learning more fun by building something *weirdly alive*  
- To get roasted by an AI I coded myself. (Therapeutic? Possibly.)

I didn't want another portfolio with placeholder text and vanilla cards.  
I wanted something that felt like *me* — introspective, slightly dramatic, and beautifully structured in beige.

## ⚙️ What This Project Does

This site is a blog powered by React where:

- Blog posts render dynamically from a data file
- A “Show More” button smoothly reveals more content
- A sidebar bot called **Luma** delivers context-aware quotes depending on which page you're on
- The entire site is styled with care — responsive, elegant, and ready for drama

You can scroll, laugh, reflect, and maybe even question your attention span — all while being gently roasted by a faceless AI.

## 🧩 What I Learned (and Fixed Along the Way)

This project wasn’t just coding — it was **debugging my brain**, too. Here's what I tackled:

### ✅ Dynamic Routing & Rendering
- I learned to structure content using React Router
- Implemented dynamic blog post pages with route parameters

### ✅ State & Logic Challenges
- Solved `useEffect` loops and `useCallback` memoization
- Created a queue of randomized, non-repeating AI quotes
- Handled conditional rendering based on current URL path
- Refactored infinite loops caused by React dependencies — yes, Luma went rogue for a while

### ✅ Netlify & ESLint Drama
- Faced several Netlify build failures because of ESLint’s strict `CI=true`
- Fixed every warning by carefully managing hook dependencies
- Refactored quote logic to stop Luma from spiraling into chaos

### ✅ Responsive UI
- Designed a panel toggle that works across screen sizes
- Refined Luma's button placement for mobile
- Styled everything with elegance and theme consistency

## 🤖 Why I Chose React

React was the perfect fit because it let me:

- Build **modular components** (like BlogPost, BlogList, and Luma's Notes)
- Create **context-aware content** based on routing
- Easily manage and rotate **stateful UI elements**
- Animate components using **Framer Motion**
- Learn best practices that will scale into future projects

It also helped me understand how a **frontend ecosystem** works — not just layout, but logic, deployment, and interactivity.

## 👩‍💻 Who This Code Is For

This repo is for:

- Developers learning React and wanting to go **beyond tutorials**
- Designers looking to build **narrative-driven, emotionally playful UIs**
- Anyone building blogs, sass bots, or sidebar companions
- People who believe a project can be both beautiful **and** technically challenging

---

## 📁 Tech Stack

- React.js  
- React Router DOM  
- Framer Motion  
- FontAwesome  
- Netlify (hosting)  
- Custom CSS (based on my soft beige / dusty pink palette)

---

## 📌 Features

- Blog post previews with “Show More” functionality
- Context-aware AI commentary on `/about`, `/contact`, and `/blog` routes
- Randomized, non-repeating quotes from Luma
- Mobile-friendly panel toggle and responsive layout
- Fully Netlify/CI-compliant code with no ESLint warnings

## 🫶 Final Thoughts

This was my **first real React project**, and it taught me more than I expected — not just about components and hooks, but about debugging, clean code, and trusting my aesthetic.

Most importantly, it reminded me that **learning to code doesn’t have to be dry**.  
It can be funny, expressive, poetic, and deeply *you* — even if an AI is mocking you the entire time.

Thanks for reading, and feel free to fork it, remix it, or roast me harder.  
You’re already halfway in if you made it this far. 😉
